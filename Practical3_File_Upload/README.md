# Practical3_File_Upload_Server_Implementation

A complete server-side file upload system using Node.js and Express that handles multipart form data, validates files, and provides secure storage with frontend integration.

## Project Overview

This implementation creates a robust file upload system featuring:
- Server-side file handling with Express and Multer
- File type and size validation
- Secure file storage with proper naming
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Complete frontend-backend integration

## Objective

Implement a server-side file upload system that can properly receive, validate, store, and serve files uploaded from React/Next.js frontend applications while learning multipart form data handling, file validation, and security best practices.

## Implementation Flow

1. **Setup Express Server Environment** - Install dependencies and create basic server structure
2. **Configure Multer Middleware** - Process multipart form data and manage file storage
3. **Create Upload Endpoints** - Develop API routes with validation and security
4. **Implement Validation and Security** - Add file type checks, size limits, and error handling
5. **Connect Frontend to Backend** - Modify frontend to communicate with Express server
6. **Test Complete System** - Verify end-to-end file upload functionality

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Project Initialization
Create and set up the backend project:
```bash
mkdir file-upload-server
cd file-upload-server
npm init -y
npm install express cors multer morgan dotenv
```

**Dependencies explained:**
- **express**: Web server framework for handling HTTP requests
- **cors**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **multer**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data (file uploads)
- **morgan**: HTTP request logger for debugging
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management

### Step 2: Basic Server Structure
Create `server.js` with basic Express configuration:
- Express app initialization
- Middleware setup (CORS, Morgan, JSON parsing)
- Static file serving for uploaded files
- Server startup on specified port

### Step 3: Environment Configuration
Create `.env` file:
```
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
```

## Implementation Details

### Multer Configuration
Configure Multer for file handling in `server.js`:

**Storage Configuration:**
- Destination: Files saved to `uploads/` directory
- Filename: Timestamp + original filename for uniqueness
- Automatic directory creation if not exists

**File Filter:**
- Allowed types: PDF, images (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
- MIME type validation for security
- Rejection of unauthorized file types

**Limits:**
- Maximum file size: 5MB per file
- Maximum files: 10 files per request
- Field size limits for form data

### Upload API Endpoint
Create `/api/upload` endpoint with:
- POST method for file uploads
- Multiple file handling capability
- File metadata response (filename, size, path)
- Success/error status codes
- Detailed error messages

### Error Handling Middleware
Implement comprehensive error handling:
- Multer-specific error handling
- File size limit errors
- File type validation errors
- General server error handling
- Consistent error response format

### CORS Configuration
Configure CORS for frontend integration:
- Allow specific origins (localhost:3000 for development)
- Enable credentials for authenticated requests
- Allow necessary HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Configure allowed headers for file uploads

## Frontend Integration

### Modified Upload Component
Update React/Next.js frontend to connect with Express backend:

**Key Changes:**
1. **API Endpoint**: Change from Next.js API route to Express server
2. **URL Update**: Point to `http://localhost:8000/api/upload`
3. **Error Handling**: Handle backend-specific error responses
4. **Progress Tracking**: Maintain Axios progress tracking functionality

### Dropzone Component Updates
Enhanced file handling for better user experience:
- PDF file support with proper preview
- File type validation on frontend
- Size limit checking before upload
- Visual feedback for drag and drop

### Preview Section Enhancement
Improved file preview functionality:
- PDF filename display instead of image preview
- File size and type information
- Upload status indicators
- Error message display

## Testing Instructions

### Start the Application
1. **Backend**: Start Express server
```bash
node server.js
```

2. **Frontend**: Start Next.js development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Valid File Upload**:
   - Upload PDF or image files under 5MB
   - Verify progress tracking works
   - Check files are saved in uploads directory
   - Confirm success response

2. **File Validation**:
   - Try uploading invalid file types
   - Test files over size limit
   - Verify error messages display correctly

3. **Multiple File Upload**:
   - Upload multiple files simultaneously
   - Check all files are processed
   - Verify individual file responses

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Test with server stopped
   - Try invalid requests
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly

## Key Concepts

### 1. Multipart Form Data
**Concept**: HTTP format for sending files and form data together
**Implementation**:
- Frontend: FormData object with file and text fields
- Backend: Multer middleware parses and extracts files
- Automatic handling of binary data and metadata

### 2. File Storage with Multer
**Concept**: Secure file handling and storage system
**Components**:
- **Storage**: Defines file destination and naming strategy
- **FileFilter**: Validates file types and prevents malicious uploads
- **Limits**: Controls file size and upload quantity

### 3. Error Handling
**Concept**: Comprehensive error management for file operations
**Implementation**:
- Frontend: Catches and displays backend errors
- Backend: Custom middleware for Multer and general errors
- User-friendly error messages for different scenarios

### 4. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
**Concept**: Security mechanism for cross-origin requests
**Implementation**:
- Configure allowed origins for development and production
- Enable necessary methods and headers
- Handle preflight requests for complex uploads

### 5. Progress Tracking
**Concept**: Real-time upload progress for better user experience
**Implementation**:
- Axios onUploadProgress callback
- Percentage calculation and display
- Visual progress indicators

## Security Considerations

### File Validation
- MIME type checking to prevent malicious files
- File extension validation
- Size limits to prevent server overload
- Filename sanitization to prevent path traversal

### Storage Security
- Files stored outside web root when possible
- Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts
- Directory permissions properly configured
- Regular cleanup of temporary files

### Request Validation
- Input sanitization for form fields
- Rate limiting for upload endpoints
- Authentication checks for sensitive uploads
- Proper error messages without information leakage
