# Practical5_Implementing_Cloud_Storage_With_Supabase

A comprehensive guide to migrating from local file storage to cloud storage using Supabase Storage for a TikTok clone application, enhancing scalability, reliability, and performance.

## Project Overview

This implementation upgrades a TikTok web application by:
- Migrating from local file storage to Supabase cloud storage
- Implementing direct file uploads from frontend to cloud storage
- Setting up proper access control and security policies
- Enhancing application scalability and reliability
- Providing global CDN distribution for better performance

## Understanding Cloud Storage

### Limitations of Local Storage
Local file storage has several critical limitations:
- **Disk Space**: Limited server storage capacity
- **Scaling Issues**: Files unavailable across multiple servers
- **Reliability**: Risk of data loss during server crashes or redeployments
- **Performance**: No CDN benefits for global access
- **Backup**: Lack of automatic backup systems

### Benefits of Cloud Storage
Cloud storage provides significant advantages:
- **Scalability**: Virtually unlimited storage capacity
- **Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and backup systems
- **Performance**: Global CDN distribution for faster access
- **Security**: Advanced permissions and access control
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Pay-per-use model without infrastructure management

### Cloud Storage Flow
Typical web application file handling with cloud storage:
1. **Frontend Upload**: User selects file through browser
2. **Direct Upload**: File uploads directly to cloud storage provider
3. **Metadata Storage**: Server stores file metadata in database
4. **Access Control**: Cloud provider handles file permissions
5. **Content Serving**: Files served directly from CDN

## Supabase Storage Introduction

### What is Supabase?
Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative providing:
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- Authentication
- Storage
- Real-time subscriptions
- Edge Functions

### Supabase Storage Features
- File storage with customizable access controls
- Automatic CDN content delivery
- Fine-grained security rules
- Easy integration with existing projects
- Bucket-based file organization

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Supabase Project Setup

#### Create Supabase Account and Project
1. Visit supabase.com and create account or login
2. Click "New Project" and enter project name (e.g., "tiktok")
3. Choose strong database password and store securely
4. Select region closest to target audience
5. Click "Create new project" and wait for completion

#### Create Storage Buckets
1. Navigate to "Storage" in Supabase dashboard sidebar
2. Click "Create Bucket"
3. Create "videos" bucket with "Public" access level
4. Create "thumbnails" bucket with "Public" access level

#### Configure Storage Policies
Set up access policies for buckets:

**Videos Bucket Policies:**
1. **Upload Policy**: "Authenticated users can upload videos"
   - Target roles: authenticated
   - Allowed operations: all
2. **View Policy**: "Public can view videos"
   - Target roles: anon, authenticated
   - Allowed operations: SELECT

**Thumbnails Bucket Policies:**
- Apply similar policies for thumbnails bucket

### Step 2: Backend Implementation

#### Install Supabase SDK
Navigate to server directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

#### Create Supabase Client Configuration
Create `src/lib/supabase.js` with:
- Supabase client initialization
- Environment variable validation
- Error handling for missing credentials

#### Update Environment Variables
Add to `.env` file:
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key
SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
SUPABASE_STORAGE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co/storage/v1
```

**Finding Supabase Credentials:**
- Go to Settings > API in Supabase dashboard
- Copy "Project URL" for SUPABASE_URL
- Use "service_role" API key for SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- Use "anon" public API key for SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY

#### Create Storage Service
Create `src/services/storageService.js` with functions for:
- File upload to Supabase buckets
- File deletion from storage
- URL generation for stored files
- Error handling for storage operations

#### Update Video Controller
Modify `videoController.js` to:
- Use Supabase for file storage in createVideo
- Handle file deletion in deleteVideo
- Store storage paths in database
- Generate public URLs for file access

#### Update Prisma Schema
Add storage path fields to Video model:
```prisma
model Video {
  id                   Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId               Int      @map("user_id")
  caption              String?
  videoUrl             String   @map("video_url")
  thumbnailUrl         String?  @map("thumbnail_url")
  videoStoragePath     String?  @map("video_storage_path")
  thumbnailStoragePath String?  @map("thumbnail_storage_path")
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### Create Migration Script
Create `scripts/migrateVideosToSupabase.js` for:
- Migrating existing local videos to Supabase
- Updating database with new storage paths
- Handling migration errors and rollback

### Step 3: Frontend Implementation

#### Install Supabase Client
Navigate to frontend directory and install:
```bash
cd tiktok_frontend
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

#### Create Frontend Supabase Configuration
Create `src/lib/supabase.js` with:
- Client-side Supabase initialization
- Public key configuration
- Environment variable validation

#### Update Frontend Environment Variables
Create or update `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
```

#### Update Upload Service
Modify `src/services/uploadService.js` to:
- Handle direct uploads to Supabase
- Generate unique file names
- Provide upload progress tracking
- Handle upload errors and retries

#### Update Upload Page Component
Modify `src/app/upload/page.jsx` to:
- Use direct Supabase uploads
- Handle file validation on client side
- Show upload progress to users
- Manage upload state and errors
